JPEG files store EXIF tags containing your GPS coordinates accurate within 3 meters.</p><h4>The 'Send via WhatsApp' Trap</h4><p>Many sellers send extra photos via private message. Unlike the Vinted platform which compresses slightly, direct sending delivers the raw original file with all your personal data.</p><h4>The GhostMeta Solution</h4><p>By processing your photos in GhostMeta before uploading, you neutralize these digital signatures. Our tool rebuilds the image pixel by pixel to ensure no ghost data remains.</p>"

For actual purging, use a local processing tool.</p><h4>On Android</h4><p>Android systems are particularly verbose. Besides GPS, they store lens serial numbers and capture settings (ISO, speed), creating a real hardware fingerprint.</p><h4>Why Local Processing?</h4><p>Using a cloud app to clean photos is like giving your data to a third party so they can hide it from others. GhostMeta cleans in your RAM, without any file transfer.</p>"
